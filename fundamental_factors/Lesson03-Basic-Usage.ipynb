    "\n",
    "The first step when using Sharadar fundamentals is to decide which \"dimension\" you want to use. There are 6 possible dimensions, resulting from the combination of 3 possible reporting windows and 2 ways of handling restatements. The 3 reporting windows are:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Q = Quarterly: metrics reflect financial results for the fiscal quarter\n",
    "* Y = Annual: metrics reflect financial results for the fiscal year\n",
    "* T = Trailing-Twelve Month: metrics reflect financial results for the trailing twelve months (previous 4 quarters)\n",
    "\n",
    "The 2 ways of handling restatements are:\n",
    "\n",
    "* AR = As-Reported: metrics reflect the values as originally reported by the company\n",
    "* MR = Most Recently Reported: metrics reflect the most recently reported values\n",
    "\n",
    "For historical research, most quants prefer to use As-Reported data, because it most accurately represents what would have originally been known at the time of trade.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus the 6 possible dimensions are:\n",
    "\n",
    "* ARQ = As-Reported Quarterly\n",
    "* ARY = As-Reported Annual\n",
    "* ART = As-Reported Trailing-Twelve Month\n",
    "* MRQ = Most Recently Reported Quarterly\n",
    "* MRY = Most Recently Reported Annual\n",
    "* MRT = Most Recently Reported Trailing-Twelve Month\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we will use as-reported, trailing-twelve-month fundamentals. To do so, we use the `slice()` method of `zipline.pipeline.sharadar.Fundamentals` to select the desired dimension. `Fundamentals` is a `DataSetFamily`, and calling its `slice()` method returns a `DataSet`:"
