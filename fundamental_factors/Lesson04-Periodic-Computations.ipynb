    "# Periodic Computations\n",
    "\n",
    "When analyzing price data, it is common to compute changes in prices over time, such as calculating a 52-week high or a 50-day moving average. We call these \"windowed computations\" because they involve looking at a window of data rather than a single price observation. In Pipeline, factors that accept a `window_length` parameter are used to perform windowed computations. For example, `SimpleMovingAverage(inputs=EquityPricing.close, window_length=10)` computes the average of the last 10 days of closing prices.\n",
    "\n",
    "Just as with price data, it is often useful to compute changes in fundamental values over time. For example, you might want to compute 5-year dividend growth or screen for companies who have consistently grown their earnings over a certain number of quarters. Typical window-based Pipeline factors like `SimpleMovingAverage` aren't suitable for fundamental data because fundamental data changes quarterly, not daily. We don't want to compute the average dividend of the last N days but of the last N quarters.\n",
    "\n",
    "Pipeline makes it easy to perform computations on multiple quarters or years of fundamental data. These are referred to as \"periodic computations\" because they use fiscal periods rather than the daily values that are used in typical windowed computations like `SimpleMovingAverage`. There are ready-made factors to compute the average, high, low, percent change, or CAGR of a fundamental metric over time, or to screen for companies with metrics that are consistently above or below a certain value (such as consistently positive earnings or dividends), or to screen for consistently increasing or decreasing metrics (such as consistently increasing revenue).

In contrast, a negative `period_offset` means to return data for a previous fiscal period: -1 means the immediately preceding fiscal period, -2 means two fiscal periods ago, etc. For quarterly and trailing-twelve-month dimensions, previous period means previous quarter, while for annual dimensions, previous period means previous year.\n",
